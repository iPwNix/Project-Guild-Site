                      Thank you for your interest in Aegis of Envy. To begin the process of becoming a member of the team, you will need to fill out an application. We understand that applications can sometimes be tedious, however the purpose of a guild application is to examine the personality and potential ability of the player that is interested in membership based on their responses. Please put thought and time into your application and we will do the same while reviewing it. We do not believe in wasting time with people who cannot perform or are looking for a short-term commitment.

                    Our raid schedule on during progression content is 3 days a week during the following times:

                    <ul>
                      <li>Monday 20:00-23:00</li>
                      <li>Tuesday 20:00-23:00</li>
                      <li>Wednesday 20:00-23:00</li>
                    </ul>

                    Raid invites start at 7:45pm and conclude at 11:00pm, however we may vote to stay for an extra pull if a kill is imminent. The schedule is reduced as content becomes farmable in less time than we originally needed. Apart from main raid we also host various alt, carry, achievement, and mount runs throughout the week. Aegis of Envy main raid requires at least 95% attendance to maintain a core spot.

                    Our trial period consists of raiding 3-4 full weeks with us. During this period, you will be evaluated on multiple things. The first and most obvious, your ability to perform at an efficient level. We will watch our recruits to see if they are accountable for their mistakes and able to fix them in a timely manner. After this, we look for the smaller things. We aim to keep a comfortable environment and want recruits to enjoy their time with us and vise versa. This does not mean you have to be a chatter mouth, but we do expect a certain level of respect and conduct given by all of our members in and out of raid.

                    We believe in getting things done and pushing progression, but we don’t enjoy people that consistently have a negative outlook or attitude about everything. You should have pride in the guild and be proud of the tag under your name. We expect you to represent us with a positive outlook on Silvermoon and to be ambassadors for the guild. With our extensive experience, we easily identify players that are here for loot, cause drama and various “warning signs.” Make sure you are applying for the right reasons.

                    Please read our Member Requirements 
                    <a href="/rules" target="_blank">HERE</a> to learn about our guild policies, looting and nearly every answer to any questions you may have. Please be sure to clear up any final questions you might have before submitting your application. We do not believe in wasting your time, so please do not waste ours with avoidable confusion.

                    Once you have submitted an application, our officers will discuss it amongst each other, and will often ask you for feedback to address any concerns they may have. Please check our forum frequently to keep your application process moving. We do our best to ensure quick turn-around time on your application, however given your class, role and our current roster, some time may be required to ensure we can back up whatever position we offer you.
