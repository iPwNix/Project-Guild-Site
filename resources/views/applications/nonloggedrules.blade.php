                    <div class="paraf-text">
                      Members interested in raiding with Aegis of Envy must have exceptional raid performance. Players are required to have a heightened sense of raid awareness and ability to execute boss mechanics near-flawlessly. Players capable of adapting to their raid environment efficiently and expediently are highly valued. This includes changing talents/glyphs/specs between bosses to better suit the encounter. Mechanic execution is prioritised over numbers that show up on the damage meter (meter padding during progression will lead to forfeiting your raid position). Ignoring boss mechanics to improve your meter performance is not acceptable. We do not carry people that are incapable of adapting quickly and executing mechanics consistently (regardless of their seniority or relationships with other players).

                  <div class="paraf-text">
                    Core raiders must have 100% attendance. Unexcused absences are unacceptable (no-call, no-show, no-follow up). You are allowed to post on the forums with at least a 24 hour notice if you know you will be absent on a certain raid night. However, these absences are not encouraged and will still certainly count against you. If an emergency occurs that prevents you from giving 24 hours notice, then do your best to communicate with administration. As long as it's a one-time thing, emergencies will not be counted against a raider's attendance.

                    Negatively impacting the raid by distracting yourself with non-raid-relevant things (such as Skype, other programs, etc) is not acceptable. Players will be given a warning as a first offence. Further offences may affect their membership within Aegis of Envy.

                    Causing tension and lowering the morale of other members is completely unacceptable. It wastes time from our administrative members when they need to settle issues between feuding players. Members of Aegis of Envy need to maintain an extremely high level of professionalism. 
                    They need to be able to set their emotions aside and make decisions that are most beneficial for the guild as a whole. This means being able to pick and choose your battles properly. If you are having issues with other member(s), then it is your responsibility to contact administration immediately and let them handle it.

                    Members who go above and beyond the call of duty are highly valued. Aegis of Envy is comprised of highly dedicated members who all work hard to achieve a similar goal. We do not carry people. Here are examples that are important characteristics of a proactive raider:

                      <li>-Involvement on the forums</li>
                      <li>-Involvement in Discord, getting to know your peers is important for creating a team-oriented environment. Don't be a hermit; get to know the raiders around you.</li>
                      <li>-Involvement with raid strategy and discussion (strategy session screen shares, raiding discussion forums, Google Docs, etc)</li>
                      <li>-Spending time outside of raid to work on your raid performance (UI, rotation, theory crafting, researching your class, reading upcoming patch notes, etc)</li>
                      <li>-Getting involved with handling administrative duties</li>
                      <li>-Taking initiative and being productive for well-being of Aegis of Envy</li>

                    Synergy plays a key part in the success of Aegis of Envy. This is a team-oriented environment. Members must be able to work together in a mature and professional manner. Personality and communication skills are highly valued attributes.

                    Aegis of Envy cares about our public persona. It is for this reason we ask that unless you are buying/selling items offering or engaging services you are asked to not post in Trade/General/Instance chats. Trolling is not tolerated and can have you removed from the guild.

                    This variable isn't valued highly, but it's certainly something we take into account. Too many times have we witnessed long-term members generate a level of complacency and entitlement over other members (this kind of behaviour will be met with zero tolerance). Members of Aegis of Envy are required to continue to improve their performance. Being with the guild for a long period of time does not excuse you from continuing to execute the responsibilities required to be a member. However, being with the guild for a long period of time certainly shows a level of dedication that we appreciate.

                  <div class="paraf-text">
                    For example, let's say we ideally want to run two mages in the raid. This doesn't mean that we only invite our best two mages to every raid. Nor does it mean that we only run two mages on our roster. Players of the same class/spec will always have separations in skill level, mechanic execution, and other variables. For progression-oriented purposes, we will be bringing our best players of each class/spec for current, necessary raid composition. That being said, we would ideally want all of our players of the same class/spec (not just the two best) to have relatively equal performance. That way we can effectively rotate our raiders in and out of the raid to keep everyone consistent. Also, if we ever want to stack a certain class because they are good on a particular fight, then we have more than two skilled players to bring into the fight that are all capable of executing the mechanics and performance necessary for competitive raiding. The goal of Aegis of Envy is for players to work with one another, bounce ideas off of each other, and be able to fill in due to potential emergency absences.

                  <div class="paraf-text">
                    Being sat from a raid does not mean that you're a bad player (you won't be on our raiding roster if you're a bad player). It also doesn't mean that we don't value you as a member. If you're ever unsure about where you stand in the guild, then contact an administrator at an appropriate time and they can help explain what we perceive are your strengths and weaknesses as a raider.

                    Players not in the raid group are expected to be ready at raid times. Being sat from a raid does not mean that you get to AFK for the rest of the night. Raiding with Aegis of Envy is a commitment that you make. You also need to be ready to come into the raid at any moment for any reason.
